HW 1 for RBE 549 - Computer Vision, WPI 2025

To run 
`python Wrapper.py`

`main()` has two methods: `calc_intrinsics_baseline()` and `calc_intrinsics()`. The first of which is for calculating the instriniscs using cv2s example formulation found [here](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html), and the latter of which was developed by me.

Both functions expect data to be in a folder labeled "Calibration_Imgs/" in the same directory as Wrapper.
